  name                = "TESTCLIENT"
  description         = "Test client"
  application_id      = data.hsdp_connect_mdm_application.test_app.id
  global_reference_id = "some-ref-here"
  
  scopes         = [ "cn", "introspect", "email", "profile" ]
  default_scopes = [ "cn", "introspect" ]
  
  redirection_uris = [
    "https://foo.bar/auth",
    "https://testapp.cloud.pcftest.com/auth",
  ]

  response_types = ["code", "code id_token"]
  
  user_client = true
}
```
