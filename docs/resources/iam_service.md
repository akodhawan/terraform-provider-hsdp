  name                = "TESTSERVICE"
  description         = "Test service"
  application_id      = var.app_id

  validity            = 12

  scopes              = ["openid"]
  default_scopes      = ["openid"]
}
```

* `private_key` - (Generated) The active private of the service

## Import

Existing services can be imported, however they will be missing their private key rendering them pretty much useless. Therefore, we recommend creating them using the provider.
